This project explores the CAMELYON16 dataset (https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/Data/) using OpenSlide (https://openslide.org/) and applies a prediction deep learning model for breast cancer detection. 

This dataset includes various zoom levels of breast histopathology slides, which corresponding masks that illustrate where cancer is. The purpose of the project is to create a functional end-to-end prototype with reasonable prediction scores. 


Idea inspired by this paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02442), for Deep Learning class at Columbia University (2019).
